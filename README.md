## 1.Introduction
### Motivation

This project was initiated as the first step toward building a future quadruped or bipedal robot from scratch — starting from its most fundamental unit: the actuator.
Instead of relying on commercial servo modules, I aimed to design and build a custom actuator that offers high torque density, structural rigidity, and mechanical efficiency, optimized for legged locomotion. <br>

Among various transmission mechanisms, I chose a cycloidal reduction drive due to its high torque capability, compact size, backlash resistance, and shock absorption characteristics.
Compared to traditional planetary or harmonic drives, cycloidal reducers distribute loads over multiple contact points, resulting in smoother torque transmission and better durability — an essential feature for dynamic robotic motion. <br>

Throughout the development, I referred to several open-source and academic actuator designs available in the community (see References section) and focused on reproducing them as accurately as possible to deepen my understanding of their structure and performance.
The primary objective was not to innovate or redesign, but to analyze, rebuild, and validate the principles behind existing cycloidal actuators as a foundation for future improvements and original designs. <br>

This cycloidal actuator project therefore serves as a starting point — a practical and modular prototype built to gain hands-on experience in actuator design and testing.
It lays the foundation for developing custom joint actuators that will eventually be integrated into my future quadruped and biped robot prototypes.

### Brief description of a cycloidal actuator

<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d437594-0b52-49f6-8125-b9d21f271b29" />


A cycloidal actuator is a type of precision reduction drive that converts the high-speed, low-torque rotation of a motor into low-speed, high-torque output through an eccentric and rolling motion mechanism. <br>

Unlike traditional planetary or harmonic gear systems, a cycloidal drive uses: <br>
- An eccentric cam that drives a cycloidal disc with offset motion,
- Multiple rolling pins or needle bearings that transmit torque smoothly,
- An output flange that averages the motion to reduce backlash.



Because torque is distributed over multiple contact points, the mechanism achieves: <br>

- High torque density and shock load tolerance,
- Low backlash,
- Compact structure,
- And often better 3D-printability for prototyping. <br><br>

This project uses two cycloidal discs arranged with inverted eccentricity. By employing a dual-cycloid structure, the unbalanced forces generated by each disc are largely canceled out, resulting in a more stable center of mass and reduced vibration during operation. Although this configuration adds some mechanical complexity, it offers smoother motion and improved overall balance compared to a single-disc design. <br>

The actuator features an 9 : 1 reduction ratio, meaning the motor must rotate nine times for the output shaft to complete one full revolution. This reduction increases the output torque while lowering the rotational speed, which is ideal for robotic joints requiring high torque and precise control. <br>

The reduction ratio of a cycloidal drive is determined by the number of housing pins ($$N_p$$) and the number of lobes on the cycloidal disc ($$N_c$$), following the formula: <br>

$$Reduction \ Ratio = \frac{N_p}{N_p - N_c}$$ <br>

In our case, the housing contains 9 pins and the cycloidal disc has 8 lobes, the resulting reduction ratio is: <br>

$$ 
\frac{9}{9 - 8} &rarr; 9 \ :1
$$ <br>

This means that one full revolution of the motor causes the output shaft to rotate 1/9 of a turn, providing roughly nine times the motor’s torque at the output. <br>

Below is an image showing a cross section of the final design. <br>

## 2.Build Process

### Coil Winding

The stator used in this actuator is a 10010 brushless motor core, which I manually wound using 26 AWG magnet wire with six parallel strands per phase. <br>
Instead of a single thick conductor, multiple thinner wires are wound in parallel to achieve the same total cross-sectional area while improving space utilization, flexibility, and thermal dissipation during high-current operation. <br>

This configuration increases the total copper cross-section, enabling higher continuous current and better torque density without excessive heat buildup, while maintaining manageable wire flexibility for precise coil placement. <br>

I designed and 3D-printed a custom winding fixture that allows six parallel strands of 26 AWG magnet wire to be evenly guided and tensioned during the coil winding process.

</p>

After designing the coil winding tool, a fixed ring was CNC-machined from aluminum 6061 and press-fitted onto the 10010 brushless motor stator. Following this assembly, the manual coil winding process was initiated using six parallel strands of 26 AWG magnet wire per phase.

</p>

The winding layout was determined by referring to the [Bavaria Direct BLDC winding calculator](https://www.bavaria-direct.co.za/scheme/calculator/)
, based on a configuration of 36 stator slots and 42 magnet poles.

</p>

As illustrated in the figure above, all stator teeth were wound according to the same coil pattern, ensuring consistent phase alignment and uniform winding distribution.

</p>

<br>

### Soldering

After completing the coil winding, I twisted all the end wires together and soldered them to form the phase connections.
Instead of using a magnet wire stripping machine, I manually removed the insulation from the magnet wire surfaces using sandpaper, then performed the soldering process.
Finally, each solder joint was insulated and reinforced with heat-shrink tubing for protection and durability.

<img width="520" height="480" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/975f8a89-cd26-4ebb-a008-9066c4f640ab">

</p>

The start lines were also stripped manually using sandpaper, similar to the end wires.
After removing the enamel insulation, I soldered 16 AWG electric wires to each phase (A, B, and C) to serve as the main power leads.

### Assembly steps

Unlike non-magnetic materials such as plastic or aluminum, which do not conduct magnetic flux and cause magnetic leakage, mild steel 1045 provides a strong magnetic path for the rotor.
Therefore, the rotor was CNC-machined from mild steel 1045 to ensure efficient flux return and minimize magnetic losses, resulting in higher torque and overall performance.

<p align="center">
<img width="520" height="480" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6426657-5d74-4af6-bd88-a2b4c78b7c9d">
</p>

Because the rotor is made of steel, its surface was coated to prevent corrosion. A surfacer primer was applied as the base layer, and a matte finish paint was used as the top coat to protect the metal surface and improve durability.

<p align="center">
<img width="520" height="480" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b28c8248-eb8e-4580-ac8e-02ee30f6d4a6">
</p>

After the surface treatment, magnets were attached to the rotor, arranged alternately with N and S poles around its circumference to form the magnetic field pattern for the actuator.

</p>

After this step, I continued the assembly process while referring to the final assembly model and reference documentation provided by the original project to ensure correct component alignment and configuration.

</p>

During assembly, installing the bearings was particularly challenging. Because a dedicated bearing press tool was not available, I used a bench vise to press-fit the bearings into the housing with controlled pressure.
